// Writeup
// Koch Curve:
// The Koch curve is created by dividing each line segment into thirds and replacing the
// middle segment with an equilateral triangle. Each iteration of the Koch curve produces a
// curve that is self-similar to the previous ones.
// Step1:
// Draw an equilateral triangle. You can draw it with a compass or protractor, or just eyeball it if
// you don’t want to spend too much time drawing the snowflake.
//  It’s best if the length of the sides are divisible by 3, because of the nature of this fractal. This
// will become clear in the next few steps.

// Step2:
// Divide each side in three equal parts. This is why it is handy to have the sides divisible by
// three.

// Step3:Draw an equilateral triangle on each middle part. Measure the length of the middle third
// to know the length of the sides of these new triangles.

// Step4: Divide each outer side into thirds. You can see the 2nd generation of triangles covers a
// bit of the first. These three line segments shouldn’t be parted in three.

// Step5:
// Draw an equilateral triangle on each middle part.
//  Note how you draw each next generation of parts that are one 3rd of the mast one.
